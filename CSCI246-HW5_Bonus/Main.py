"""
CITATION: Consulted Dr Mumey on the best strategy for solving this problem, wherein he told me that all I had to do was to
    I should tie all of our previously used homework methods together and follow the pseudocode from chapter 7 of the
    textbook. Claude from Anthropic to aid in tying the methods together properly and ensure everything was working.
    Outputs from the below code match the textbook examples.
